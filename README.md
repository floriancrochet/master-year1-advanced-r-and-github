firstlibflorian is an R package designed to analyze, summarize, and
visualize demographic and geographic data for French communes and
departments.
The package originates from coursework in Advanced R and Introduction to
Git and includes S3 classes, reporting tools, documentation, vignettes,
and pkgdown integration.

Core objectives:

-   Provide constructors and summaries for custom classes commune and
    departement
-   Enable statistical and demographic reporting through Quarto
-   Offer clear visualizations using ggplot2
-   Ensure reproducibility and professional documentation

    creer_departement()
-   Statistical summaries with summary.commune() and
    summary.departement()
-   Visualizations via plot.commune() and plot.departement()
-   Automated generation of Quarto reports through generer_rapport()
-   Integration with pkgdown to publish documentation
-   Support for vignettes built with Quarto

## 🔍 Main Functions

Constructors

-   creer_commune()
    Creates an S3 object of class commune.

-   creer_departement()
    Creates an S3 object of class departement.

Summary Methods

-   summary.commune()
    Displays commune-level demographic summaries (number of elected
    officials, age distribution, oldest/youngest elected person, etc.).

-   summary.departement()
    Summarizes departmental information (number of communes, age
    distribution, etc.).

Visualization Methods

-   plot.commune()
-   plot.departement()
    Produce visual representations of commune or department data.

Reporting

-   generer_rapport()
    Generates a Quarto report (rapport.html) for a chosen commune and
    department, then moves it to the user-specified destination.

---

## 📊 Results

Example output from generer_rapport() includes:

-   Age distribution tables
-   Lists of youngest/oldest elected officials
-   Commune- and department-level statistics
-   Visualizations generated by the plot.* S3 methods

  To be completed (insert illustration when available).
